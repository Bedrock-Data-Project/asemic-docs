# Metrics Library Documentation

## Overview
Welcome to our comprehensive Metrics Library. This library provides a standardized approach to tracking, measuring, and analyzing user behavior, business performance, and technical metrics across different types of applications and platforms.

## Purpose
The Metrics Library serves several key purposes:
- Establish consistent definitions for common metrics
- Provide standardized calculation methods
- Enable cross-platform and cross-product analysis
- Support data-driven decision making
- Ensure metric reliability and accuracy

## Library Structure

### 1. Core Components

#### Events
Events are the fundamental building blocks of our metrics system. Each event represents a specific user action or system occurrence that we want to track.

```yaml
table_name: analytics.event_name
tags: [event_type1, event_type2]
columns:
  _id: 
    data_type: STRING
  _user:
    data_type: STRING
    tags: [entity_id_column]
  _time:
    data_type: DATETIME
    tags: [event_timestamp_column]
  # Additional columns...
```

#### Properties
Properties are derived values calculated from events. They can be:
- Event Properties (direct measurements)
- Computed Properties (calculated values)
- Sliding Window Properties (rolling calculations)
- Lifetime Properties (cumulative values)

#### KPIs
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are high-level user metrics that provide insights into business performance and user behavior.

### 2. Categories

Our library includes metrics for:
- Standard Activity
- Monetization
- User Acquisition
- Engagement
- Performance

## Usage Guidelines

### 1. Selecting Metrics

When choosing metrics:
1. Start with standard metrics
2. Add core metrics for your domain
3. Add specific metrics for your use case

### 2. Best Practices

#### Naming Conventions
- Use snake_case for property names
- Use descriptive, consistent names
- Include units in metric names when applicable
- Add clear labels for visualization

#### Calculations
- Use `SAFE_DIVIDE` for division operations
- Include default values for properties
- Consider data latency in window calculations
- Document complex calculations
